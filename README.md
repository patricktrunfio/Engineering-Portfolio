# Engineering-Portfolio
Included in this Portfolio are 3 design projects I have been a part of over the past 2 years. Pintle Geometry Senior Project was a semester long project to research the effects of orifice configuration on the spray cone of pintle rocket injectors. Included in this section are the intial proposal, final report, and poster presentation summarizing the final results. The Centrifugal Governor Design Project was a final group project for a course on Computer-Aided Design of Mechanical Systems. In it there is a final report documenting the process for optimizing and validating of the specified mechanical component. The Conduction Experiment Design section shows an experiment designed as an assignment in my junior year Mechoptronic B course. The project asked partners to design an experiment that could be potentially used in future mechoptronic courses. The experiment was required to be inexpensive and demonstrate a key physical phenomena with results predicted using a simplified model. Included in the section is the initial project proposal as well as the final presentation given to classmates.
